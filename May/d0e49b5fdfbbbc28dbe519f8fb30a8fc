Spectators are returning big time for the 148th Kentucky Derby at Churchill Downs, which aims for close to full capacity beneath the Twin Spires for the first time since 2019 before the coronavirus pandemic. Friday's Kentucky Oaks provided a nice warmup as 100,188 took in the race for 3-year-old fillies. For Saturday's $3 million marquee event, Zandon was the morning-line favorite, drawing 3-1 odds Monday. As of Saturday afternoon, the winner of last month's Blue Grass at Keeneland in Lexington had 7-1 odds. Epicenter, initially expected to be the Derby favorite, and Santa Anita Derby winner Taiba    were the favored betting choices Saturday afternoon at 5-1 each. The odds will keep changing leading up to the 6:57 p.m. ET post time. This year's race will happen without suspended Hall of Fame trainer Bob Baffert, whom Churchill Downs suspended for two years following Medina Spirit's failed postrace drug test and eventual disqualification as the winner of last year's Derby. If attendance and participation around Louisville and other major sporting events such as the Super Bowl, Final Four and Major League Baseball games are any indication, the atmosphere for the first jewel in horse racing's Triple Crown should have a pre-pandemic feel, though masks are optional. The 2020 running was delayed until Labor Day weekend, then held without spectators. It returned to its familiar spring slot eight months later in 2021, but with limited capacity. At the very least this year should feature the spectrum of women in big hats and fascinators and men in seersucker suits, sipping bourbon and mint juleps as cigar smoke wafts through the air.
