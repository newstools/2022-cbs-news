It's a hard fact: America's gun deaths are at a 20-year high. Per data released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in May 2022, firearm homicide rates grew nearly 35% from 2019 to 2020, with disparities by race, ethnicity and poverty level widening. Firearm suicide rates also remained high. This year is also seeing a rise in school shootings. In 2020, the year of pandemic shutdowns, there were 10; 2021 saw 34. And the first five months of 2022 already witnessed 27, including the horrific massacre in Uvalde, Texas, according to Education Week, which has tracked school shootings since 2018.
