Cole Emhoff, the son of second gentleman Doug Emhoff, is engaged to his longtime girlfriend Greenley Littlejohn. The proposal took place in front of a bonfire, according to a video Littlejohn shared on her Instagram account. "Surrounded by friends and family in my favorite place I said yes to the love of my life! Can't wait to combine our family," she wrote. Doug Emhoff told reporters on Monday that "we're really excited" about the engagement. "Greenley's going to be a great part of our family, we love her, we love him," Emhoff said. "And we couldn't be prouder of them." The video did not include the second gentleman nor Vice President Kamala Harris, who is currently quarantining after testing positive for COVID-19 last week. Cole Emhoff is one of two children from Emhoff's first marriage to Kerstin Emhoff, a film producer. Harris has noted how both Cole and his sister Ella refer to her as "Momala." In an essay for Elle last year, Harris wrote that she and Kerstin hit it off "immediately," and Kerstin Emhoff attended the 2021 inauguration with her children. In the Elle essay, Harris wrote "Cole and Ella could not have been more welcoming. They are brilliant, talented, funny kids who have grown to be remarkable adults. I was already hooked on Doug, but I believe it was Cole and Ella who reeled me in." Cole currently lives in Los Angeles and works in the entertainment industry.
