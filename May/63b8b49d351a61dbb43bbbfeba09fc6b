Gasoline prices hit a new record on Tuesday just as Americans are entering peak summer driving season. The national average price for a gallon of gas hit $4.37, according to AAA, eclipsing a previous record set in early March. The largest increases are coming in Michigan, New Jersey, Connecticut, Kentucky and Indiana, according to AAA. In dollar terms, the priciest states for gas are in the West: California, Hawaii, Alaska, Nevada and Oregon have the most expensive gasoline, with California's gas averaging $5.82 per gallon. Gasoline prices are going up even though the price of crude oil — its biggest input — has fallen this week, to $105 per gallon. A squeeze on oil refineries, which turn crude oil into gasoline and other products, is behind the latest price high. Refinery capacity in the U.S. has gradually shrunk, with the nation losing about 1 million barrels per day of refining capacity since before the pandemic. "Why can oil move down but wholesale gas prices move up? Because  they're different. They may be similar, but refining is the kink in the  hose, and we're down 1 [million barrels per day] refining capacity vs  early 2019," Patrick DeHaan, head of petroleum analysis for GasBuddy, said on Twitter. A ban on oil and gas imports from Russia, which sent some refined products to the U.S., is also contributing to the shortage. "The             lack             of             refined              product,             finished             product             and              intermediates             coming             out             of              Russia     created a            shortage             for              sure," Michael Sinclair, CEO of HF Sinclair, a petroleum refiner, said on a call with investors this week. "I don't              see             any             signs             of             it              ending             sooner             or             well.              So,             I             think             that              the             draw             on             U.S.             refining              capacity             is             going             to be              very             strong." Jennings said that the drop in capacity as well as crude oil supply since before the pandemic amounts to 2.5% of world consumption. "It's             a              big             number," he said. "I              think             that             we             can              expect,             assuming             the             economies              stay             reasonably             strong,             that              the             commodity             prices             and              particularly             the prices             of              our             products             are             going              to be             relatively             high." According to Reuters,  distillers have shifted output to create more diesel and jet fuel  to meet demand in Europe. That means they're producing less gasoline at  a time of year when gas output should normally rise to prepare for  summer's busy driving season. According to the Energy Information Administration, gasoline stocks in the U.S. dropped by 2.2 million barrels last week, while gasoline demand rose  from 8.74 million barrels a day to 8.86 million.
