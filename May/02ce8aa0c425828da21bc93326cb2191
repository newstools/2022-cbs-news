A top law enforcement official provided the most detailed description yet Friday of what happened during this week's school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, when a gunman killed 19 children and two teachers. Texas Department of Public Safety Director Steven McCraw cited video footage and audio evidence to reconstruct the chain of events in 18-year-old Salvador Ramos' attack on Robb Elementary School on Tuesday. McCraw offered a timeline of what authorities know thus far in their investigation into the rampage. All times listed are in Central Daylight Time: Shortly before Tuesday's shooting, the gunman sent three private Facebook messages that he was going to shoot his grandmother, that he had done so and that he was going to "go shoot up" a school, McCraw said. Governor Greg Abbott had earlier said the messages were posted to the social media platform, but they were not visible to the public. Investigators found other messages the gunman posted to social media in the weeks and months leading up to the shooting. In September 2021, the gunman asked his sister to help him buy a gun and she refused, McCraw said. On Feb. 28, 2022, in an Instagram group chat, it was discussed that he was "a school shooter," McCraw said. The gunman later discussed buying a gun in an Instagram group chat with four people, McCraw said. In another four-person chat, the gunman said, "Just bought something rn," McCraw said. In an Instagram post, the gunman said, "Ten more days," McCraw said. Someone asked, "Are you going to shoot up a school or something?" McCraw said. The gunman replied, "No, and stop asking dumb questions, and you'll see," McCraw said.
