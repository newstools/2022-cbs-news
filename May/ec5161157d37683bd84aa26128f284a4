Editor's note: Some testimony contains graphic language and descriptions of sexual and physical assault. Testimony in the civil trial over a libel lawsuit between actors Johnny Depp and Amber Heard resumed Thursday in Virginia. The trial is in its sixth week, and closing arguments are expected Friday. Depp is suing Heard in Fairfax County Circuit Court for $50 million over a December 2018 op-ed she wrote in The Washington Post describing herself as "a public figure representing domestic abuse." His lawyers say he was defamed by the article even though it never mentioned his name. Depp has denied he ever struck Heard and says she was the abuser in the relationship. Heard has testified about more than a dozen separate instances of physical abuse she says she suffered at Depp's hands. Heard is countersuing for $100 million, claiming she was defamed by Depp's attorney calling her abuse allegations a hoax. Depp returned to the stand Wednesday to fire back at testimony from Heard's defense, calling her accusations "insane." "Ridiculous, humiliating, ludicrous, painful, savage, unbelievably brutal, cruel, and all false," Depp said when asked about his reaction to hearing Heard's allegations when she testified earlier in the trial. Depp was testifying as a rebuttal witness — both he and Heard each testified extensively earlier in the trial. Also Wednesday, supermodel Kate Moss, a former girlfriend of Depp, denied that she had ever been pushed or assaulted by Depp during the course of their relationship. Heard, in her testimony, had made a reference to Moss and a rumor that Depp had pushed Moss down a set of stairs when the two dated in the 1990s.
