Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen has been released from the hospital after he was admitted to George Washington University Hospital in Washington, D.C., for a "minor stroke" just over a week ago. The 63-year-old Maryland senator tweeted about his return home Sunday afternoon. "It's great to be back home after a long week," Van Hollen wrote. "I'm grateful for the generous outpouring of support from everyone and the dedicated care I received from the team at GW." Van Hollen announced on May 15 that he suffered a stroke while delivering a speech. He said tests revealed he suffered a "minor stroke" and would stay under observation "out of an abundance of caution." At the time, Van Hollen said he was informed there are "no long-term effects or damage as a result of this incident." Van Hollen isn't the only high-profile politician under 65 to be admitted for a stroke recently. Another Democratic senator, 49-year-old Ben Ray Luján of New Mexico, underwent surgery to ease swelling in his brain after he had suffered a stroke earlier this year. He didn't return to the Senate for roughly a month. John Fetterman, the lieutenant governor of Pennsylvania who is running for Senate in that state, suffered a stroke on May 13, days before the state's primary election. He won the Democratic primary while he was in the hospital and had a pacemaker with a defibrillator implanted. Fetterman, 52, has since been released.
