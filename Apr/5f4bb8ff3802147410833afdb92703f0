Italian confectionery giant Ferrero said Thursday it had recalled certain varieties of its Kinder chocolates from retailers in the United States due to possible salmonella contamination. The move follows recalls earlier this week in the United Kingdom and several European countries over concerns around products from Ferrero's factory in the Belgian town of Arlon, although no Kinder products have so far been found to contain the disease. The company said it was cooperating with the Food and Drug Administration over reported salmonella cases in Europe, announcing the precautionary recall of two chocolate varieties from three retailers in the United States. "There are no confirmed cases in the US to date and no other Kinder or Ferrero Products are affected by this recall," the company said in a statement. Ferrero added that it was working closely with the retailers to ensure the products were no longer "available for purchase." "We take food safety extremely seriously and every step we have taken has been guided by our commitment to consumer care." Salmonella is a type of bacteria that can cause symptoms including diarrhea, fever and stomach cramps in humans and is one of the most common food-borne infections. Most cases are caused by the ingestion of food contaminated with animal or human feces. Britain's Food Standards Agency has said 63 cases of salmonella have been identified across the UK. In France, 21 cases have been reported and 15 reported having eaten the Kinder products that have now been recalled, according to the French public health service.
