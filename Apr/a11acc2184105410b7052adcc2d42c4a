The 2022 CMT Awards aired Monday night on CBS for the first time ever. The fan-voted award show was hosted in-person by Kane Brown, who also received the most nominations this year with four, and actor Anthony Mackie. Brown stepped in after Kelsea Ballerini tested positive for COVID-19. Ballerini, who was up for three awards, co-hosted the show and performed from her home. The show, which was broadcast from Nashville, Tennessee, featured performances from legendary mother-daughter duo Wynonna and Naomi Judd, along with Kenny Chesney, Jimmie Allen, Cody Johnson, Old Dominion and more of country music's biggest stars.
