The show is moving from its usual home in Los Angeles to the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas. Trevor Noah, who hosted the ceremony in 2021, will return to host once again this year. Jon Batiste scored the most nominations with 11. Batiste is up for both Record of the Year and Album of the Year along with multiple nominations for his work on the animated film "Soul." Justin Bieber, Doja Cat and H.E.R. all scored eight nominations of their own. The ceremony will air on CBS and Paramount+ at 8 p.m. ET, with red carpet coverage beginning at 7 p.m. ET.
