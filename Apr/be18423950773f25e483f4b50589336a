The 2022 Masters Tournament tees off Thursday at the Augusta National Golf Club. International golfers including Jon Rahm, Justin Thomas, Cameron Smith and Tiger Woods are among those invited to participate in this year's tournament. Barring any physical setbacks, Woods is expected to make his return to competitive golf after a 17-month hiatus, and a little over a year after nearly losing his right leg in a car crash. "As of right now, I feel like I'm going to play," the five-time champion said Tuesday. Woods said he would play another nine holes on Wednesday to help make his final decision. The annual tournament in Augusta, Georgia, will occur over four rounds, finishing up Sunday night. Woods' first round tee time is scheduled for 10:34 a.m. on Thursday. He will be grouped with Louis Oosthuizen and Joaquin Niemann.
