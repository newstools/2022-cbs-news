Evidence of possible war crimes in Ukraine is mounting — and quickly — thanks to the proliferation of cell phones and other technology like drones, satellites and CCTV. "This is a very well-documented crisis. This has not been done under cover. It's been done in full view of Bellingcat or New York Times satellites that are reporting on the facts," says International Rescue Committee CEO David Miliband. "It's the first cell phone war." Miliband, a former Labour Party politician and former British foreign secretary, joined CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett on "The Takeout" this week to discuss the war in Ukraine and the humanitarian crisis spawned by Russia's invasion. Miliband identified three categories of people suffering in the weekslong conflict so far: those still trapped in cities and unable to receive aid, like the citizens of Mariupol, those internally displaced inside Ukraine, and those who have fled to neighboring countries outside of Ukraine. He also criticized the U.S. and allies for their slowness to act. They "should have taken literally and seriously the buildup that happened before February 24," when Russia launched its invasion. While Russia appears to have consolidated its forces and withdrawn from the area around Kyiv, the nation's capital, "there remains real danger," he told Garrett. The targeting of civilian structures in Ukraine over the last several weeks has raised accusations of war crimes against Russia. "If you're a soldier in a conflict, you don't have a right to life. But if you're a civilian in the conflict, you have a right to life," he told Garrett.
