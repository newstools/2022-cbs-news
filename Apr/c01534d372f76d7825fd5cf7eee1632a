Johnny Depp's attorneys are presenting recorded testimony and testimony from remote witnesses Thursday as they continue his case against ex-wife Amber Heard. The latest witnesses come after Depp's attorneys presented recorded depositions from Los Angeles Police Department officers who responded to Depp and Heard's home after a fight, as well as a doorman and a former agent Wednesday. Depp is suing Heard for libel in Fairfax County Circuit Court after she wrote an op-ed piece in The Washington Post referring to herself as "a public figure representing domestic abuse." The article doesn't mention Depp by name, but his lawyers say the article contains "defamation by implication," arguing that it clearly refers to allegations of domestic abuse made by Heard when she filed for divorce in 2016. Depp said the Post article contributed to an unfairly ruined reputation that made him a Hollywood outcast and cost him his role in the lucrative "Pirates of the Caribbean" movie franchise. Heard's attorneys say only Depp is to blame for his marred career. While the libel lawsuit is supposed to center on whether Depp was defamed in the article, most of the trial has focused on ugly details of the couple's brief marriage. Depp has denied ever striking Heard. Heard's attorneys say Depp physically and sexually abused her and that Depp's denials lack merit because he was often drunk and high to the point of blacking out. Wednesday marks the 11th day in the trial, which is expected to last a month. Depp himself concluded a grueling four days on the witness stand Monday; Heard is expected to testify later in the trial.
