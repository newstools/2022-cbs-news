A Pennsylvania police officer was killed and two were injured Thursday in a shooting while responding to a domestic disturbance, Lebanon Mayor Sherry Capello said. Police went to a home in the city at about 3:30 p.m. for the disturbance call. Nearly an hour later, gunfire broke out and officers radioed that they'd been hit, Capello said at a brief news conference. All three Lebanon City Police Department officers were taken to hospitals. One was pronounced dead. A second was in critical but stable condition and the third was in stable condition, Capello said. "This is an extremely difficult moment for everyone," she added. The suspect, a 34-year-old man from Lebanon, was killed in the shooting, Lebanon Police Chief Todd Breiner said. He was the subject of the domestic disturbance call, CBS Harrisburg, Pa. affiliate WHP-TV reports. "As one can imagine, it's clearly a traumatic event," Breiner said. "Our guys are strong, but we're human and we have families." Lebanon resident Angelo Gonzalez, 17, was working at a pizzeria down the road from the shooting when he said he saw "cop car after cop car flying down the street." "Then we heard something and weren't sure what it was and the street filled up with cops and ambulance in a matter of 15 min," Gonzalez said in a text message. The slain officer's name was being withheld pending notification of extended family members. Police didn't release further details.
