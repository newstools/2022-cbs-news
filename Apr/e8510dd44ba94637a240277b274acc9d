Most U.S. firearms go unregistered, so numbers are hard to come by. Still, there are windows into the world of gun ownership — slices of data that offer pieces to the puzzle. The RAND Corporation published a 2020 study on adults who say they live with at least one gun. And every year, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms publishes a list of federally registered guns by state. It covers only a subsection of weapons — short-barreled shotguns, short-barreled rifles, and machine guns are included, along with silencers and destructive devices like grenades, but ordinary pistols or AR-15s are not. So which states had the most such licenses in 2021? Here's the latest ranking, along with the RAND numbers, which reveal insights into America's love of guns.
