The suspect in Tuesday's violent rampage in New York City's subway system was arrested Wednesday, authorities announced. Police had been looking for Frank James, 62, since tying a U-Haul van they say he rented to Tuesday's subway shooting. Ten people were shot and wounded in the attack, and over a dozen more suffered other injuries. James is facing a federal terrorism charge and a possible punishment of life in prison, authorities said. Police are still investigating the motive behind the attack that happened during Tuesday morning's rush hour. James was arrested Wednesday afternoon in Manhattan's East Village neighborhood after police received a tip, New York Police Commissioner Keechant Sewell told reporters. James was taken into custody without incident, Sewell said. A law enforcement source told CBS News that authorities believe the man who called Crime Stoppers and tipped authorities off to James' whereabouts may have been James himself. James is scheduled to appear in Brooklyn Federal Court on Thursday, according to John Marzulli, a public information officer for the U.S. Attorney's Office, Eastern District of New York. An exact time was not given. Read the latest updates below.
