Kyiv — Explosions from what Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba called "horrific Russian rocket strikes" were heard in Ukraine's capital on Friday amid unverified reports that the fighting had already reached the heart of Kyiv. Videos posted online showed what residents said were Russian tanks driving through their city, and gunfire and air raid sirens were heard in the capital. In an address on Friday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warned that Russia was going to try to "destroy our resistance" overnight. "All of us should understand what is awaiting us this night," he said, according to Reuters. "We have to hold out. Ukraine's destiny is being decided right now." Ukrainian officials say they're fighting on multiple fronts to repel a "full-scale invasion," and President Joe Biden has accused Putin of choosing to carry out "a premeditated war that will bring a catastrophic loss of life and human suffering." Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov doubled down Friday on Putin's claim that the invasion was necessary to "demilitarize" Ukraine's Western-backed government, which the Kremlin has labeled a "Nazi cell." Lavrov said after Ukraine was "liberated from this burden, Ukrainians will have the chance to freely choose their future." But CBS News' Haley Ott reports that Ukrainians are rushing to back up their country's military forces, hoping to prevent any future on Russia's terms. Ott said people streamed into a makeshift recruitment center in Kyiv on Friday morning, saying they were ready to die to defend their city. One commander said thousands had reported for duty — very few of them with military experience. Guns were being distributed to those who showed up, and the commander said they were quickly running out.
