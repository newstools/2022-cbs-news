Berlin — A vehicle drove into pedestrians in Berlin on Wednesday, killing at least one person and injuring eight others, rescue services said. Berlin fire service spokesman Stefan Salzwedel, who confirmed the casualty figures to The Associated Press, wasn't immediately able to provide further information on the victims.   Berlin police spokesman Martin Dams said the incident happened near the popular Kurfuerstendamm shopping boulevard in the west of the German capital. He said the suspected driver of the vehicle was detained, but that it remained unclear whether the crash was the result of an accident or whether the driver had intentionally driven into the crowd. A source in Berlin's fire department told CBS News' Anna Noryskiewicz, however, that it appeared likely the Wednesday morning crash was accidental.   It happened near the Breitscheidplatz, or Breitscheid Square, where an extremist carried out a vehicle attack on a Christmas market in 2016, resulting in 13 deaths.
