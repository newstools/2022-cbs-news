A third arrest has been made in a mass shooting in Chattanooga, Tennessee, where three people died and 14 were injured. Meanwhile, police made another appeal to the public to help identify possible suspects. Rodney Harris, 31, was charged Tuesday in federal court with possession of a firearm by a felon, according to an affidavit filed with the U.S. District Court for Eastern Tennessee, news outlets reported. He was seen in a Facebook live video carrying a rifle in front of Mary's Bar & Grill and was among the gunshot victims, according to the affidavit. Alexis Lewis, 36, was charged Monday in state court with criminal homicide, reckless endangerment, and possession of a firearm during the commission or attempt to commit a dangerous felony, Chattanooga Police said in a statement. Another man, Garrian King, was arrested last week and charged in federal court with being a felon in possession of a firearm, according to court records. The shooting happened in front of Mary's Bar & Grill early on June 5. Police have said there were likely multiple shooters. Fourteen of the 17 victims were hit by gunfire, and another three were hit by vehicles while trying to flee the scene, Chattanooga Police Chief Celeste Murphy has said. Of the three who died, two were killed by gunfire, and one was killed by a vehicle. Sixteen of the victims were adults and one was a juvenile. It was not immediately clear whether Harris has an attorney. Authorities again asked for the public's help during a news conference Tuesday with the investigation into the shooting. "What we say today is if anybody has any information pertaining to this incident ... it doesn't matter how big or how small, call us, contact one of us and let us know," Chattanooga police Capt. Jerri Sutton said. The shooting came one week after six juveniles were wounded during an exchange of gunfire in a downtown Chattanooga business district.
