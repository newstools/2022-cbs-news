The 75th annual Tony Awards were held Sunday night to honor the top performances from the theater industry, following two years of Broadway disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Academy Award winner and Tony Award nominee Ariana DeBose hosted the ceremony from Radio City Music Hall in New York City. "A Strange Loop" came into the night with 11 nominations, the most for any show, and took home the awards for Best Musical and Best Book for a Musical. The Best Musical win delivered a Tony Award to Jennifer Hudson, who is one of the producers of the show, making her just the 17th ever EGOT winner, meaning she has won an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony Award. Hudson had previously won an Oscar in 2007 for her role in "Dreamgirls," a Daytime Emmy in 2021, and two Grammy Awards, one in 2009 for Best R&B Album and another in 2017 for Best Musical Theater Album. The show featured musical performances from "The Music Man," "A Strange Loop," "Company" and many more.
