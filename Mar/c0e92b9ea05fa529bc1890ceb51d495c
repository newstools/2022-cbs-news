The Norwegian military said Friday that a U.S. military aircraft with four people on board crashed in the northern part of the country. The V-22 Osprey aircraft went down in bad weather in an area with rough terrain and narrow valleys, according to the Norwegian military. The Marines confirmed "an incident has occurred involving a Marine Corps MV-22B Osprey aircraft," and that an investigation is underway. The fate of the people on board is not known. The Osprey was taking part in a NATO military exercise when it was reported missing. The V-22 Ospreys have been involved in a number of deadly crashes in recent years. In 2017, three U.S. Marines were killed when a MV-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft crashed off the coast of Australia. In April of 2000, a V-22 Marine tilt-rotor Osprey crashed during a night landing in Arizona. The horrific fireball was recorded by a camera on a second V-22. Nineteen people on board were killed. This is a developing story. It will be updated.
