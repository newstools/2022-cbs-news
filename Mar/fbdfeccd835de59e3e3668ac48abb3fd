Washington — Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, President Biden's nominee for the Supreme Court, is taking questions from senators about her judicial philosophy and record on the bench on Tuesday as the questioning phase of her confirmation hearings get underway. Jackson, currently a federal judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, began the hearing by explaining her approach to cases that come before her, saying she examines the facts of the case and relevant law from "a position of neutrality." "Over the course of my almost decade on the bench, I have developed a methodology that I use in order to ensure that I am ruling impartially and that I am adhering to the limits on my judicial authority," Jackson said. "I am acutely aware that as a judge in our system, I have limited power and I am trying in every case to stay in my lane." The first day of hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Monday featured opening statements from the 22 committee members and brief remarks from Jackson, who would make history as the first Black woman on the Supreme Court if confirmed. Democrats and Republicans alike lauded Jackson for her nomination, and many GOP members pledged to avoid personal attacks, chided their Democratic colleagues for their handling of Justice Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing in 2018. But they still vowed to probe her judicial philosophy and views of the Supreme Court. Republicans previewed the aspects of her professional record they plan to examine, namely the sentences she imposed on child pornography offenders while serving as a judge on the federal district court in Washington and clients she represented as a federal assistant public defender and in private practice. Tuesday's questioning, which can be watched on CBS News above, features 30-minute rounds of questioning by Judiciary Committee members, alternating parties in order of seniority.
