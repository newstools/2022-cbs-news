The Pentagon said Friday the Russians have fired more than 500 missiles in the week since they invaded Ukraine. Meanwhile, the Russians are closing in on several major cities with a large military convoy about 15 miles away from the capital of Kyiv. "The days to come are likely to be worse with more death, more suffering and more destruction," NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken echoed the same concern while meeting with NATO and European allies in Brussels. "We have to sustain this until it stops, until the war is over, the Russian forces leave, the Ukrainian people regain their independence," Blinken said. The U.N. Security Council held an emergency meeting Friday after Russia took control of Europe's largest nuclear power plant in Ukraine. Heavy shelling sparked a brief fire, but there are no reports of radiation escaping. "We've just witnessed a dangerous new escalation," U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield said, "that represents a dire threat to all of Europe and the world."
