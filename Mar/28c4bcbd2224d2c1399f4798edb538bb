The 94th Academy Awards have returned to the Dolby Theater in Hollywood as the top films from the last year are being honored by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. The show is being hosted by Regina Hall, Amy Schumer and Wanda Sykes, the first time the award ceremony has had multiple hosts since Anne Hathaway and James Franco cohosted the 83rd installment in 2011. "The Power of the Dog" leads the pack with 12 nominations, including for best picture, best director and multiple acting nods. Denis Villeneuve's adaptation of Frank Herbert's sci-fi epic "Dune" trails with 10 nominations. While the Oscars are back in their usual home following a modified ceremony last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, some protocols remained in place. All attendees were required to show proof of vaccination or a valid medical exemption. Performers and presenters were tested, but were not required to be vaccinated. The show ran into controversy long before it even began, when it was announced in February that eight awards would be presented off air in order to shorten the broadcast and allow more time for scripted bits and musical numbers. "Dune" won awards for sound, production design, original score and editing prior to the start of the official ceremony. The ceremony is airing on ABC. You can follow more of CBS News' coverage here.
