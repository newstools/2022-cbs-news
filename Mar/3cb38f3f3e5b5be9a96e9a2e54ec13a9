President Biden is expected to take aim at Russian President Vladimir Putin's main revenue source on Tuesday by announcing a U.S. ban on Russian oil imports over the country's invasion of Ukraine, two sources familiar with the matter told CBS News. The announcement is expected as the worst refugee crisis Europe has seen since World War II worsens, with more than 2 million people fleeing Ukraine in recent days into neighboring countries, according to the United Nations. Russian forces are now surrounding key cities and inching — apparently more slowly than they'd hoped — toward the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. Ukraine's defense forces are mounting a fierce resistance, CBS News senior foreign correspondent Charlie D'Agata reports. Reports from battered Ukrainian cities suggested that Moscow is at least partially upholding its latest promise to allow civilians to flee from its seemingly indiscriminate artillery barrage. But while a truce in the northeast Ukrainian city of Sumy appeared to be holding, some people never got the chance to flee. At least 20 people were killed in one strike on the city alone Monday evening, local officials said. Evacuations from at least one other surrounded city were quickly marred by alleged cease-fire violations. At least three previous cease-fires collapsed, with Ukraine and Russia accusing each other of breaking the truces. Ukrainian officials said Tuesday that Russia had attacked a "humanitarian corridor" out of the southern port city of Mariupol.
