The 94th Academy Awards returned to the Dolby Theater on Sunday night, with "West Side Story's" Ariana DeBose and "CODA's" Troy Kotsur making history with their wins. "Even in this weary world that we live in, dreams do come true," said DeBose. "You see an openly queer Latina woman of color who found her strength in art and I believe that's what we're here to celebrate. Kotsur is the first Deaf man to win an acting Oscar, taking home Best Supporting Actor. "This is our moment," Kotsur said in his speech, dedicating it to "CODA" and the entire Deaf community. The Oscars also returned with a host for the first time since 2019, with Regina Hall, Amy Schumer and Wanda Sykes sharing hosting duties. The hosts' biting humor took aim at an array of Hollywood stars, Florida's "Don't Say Gay" bill, and the Academy itself. "This year, the Academy hired three women to host because it's cheaper than hiring one man," Schumer said. "The Power of the Dog" led the pack with 12 nominations, including for best picture, best director and multiple acting nods. Denis Villeneuve's adaptation of Frank Herbert's sci-fi epic "Dune" followed with 10 nominations, There were still some COVID-19 protocols in place. Lin-Manuel Miranda, nominated for Best Original Song for "Dos Oruguitas" from "Encanto," tweeted Saturday night that he wouldn't be attending because his wife had tested positive for COVID-19. "Encanto" took home the statue for Best Animated film. Midway through Sunday night's broadcast, the show observed a moment of silence to honor the ongoing struggle in Ukraine. "We collectively as a global community can do more," said a statement displayed on screen. "We ask you to support Ukraine in any way you are able."
