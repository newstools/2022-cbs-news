Tracy Smith: "For how long?" Bullock: "I don't know. I don't know. Until I don't feel like I feel now when I'm in front of a camera." Smith: "Which is?" Bullock: "I want to be at home. I'm not doing anyone any favors who's investing in a project if I'm saying, 'I just want to be at home.' 'Cause I was always running, I was always running to the next thing. I just want to be present and responsible for one thing." Smith: "So, you knew shooting this movie …" Bullock: "Yeah." Smith: "This is gonna be the last one …" Bullock: "Yeah." Smith: "…for a while?" Bullock: "Yeah. And I don't know what 'a while' is. I don't know what that is."
