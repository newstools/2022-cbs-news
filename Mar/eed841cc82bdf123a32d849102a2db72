"Of most concern, severe thunderstorms with damaging winds and a few tornadoes are possible across the Southeast, heavy snow is likely from the Central Appalachians to the Interior Northeast and northern New England, and widespread high wind gusts are likely for much of the region." Forecasters said hazardous weather will be seen up and down the East Coast including heavy snow, strong winds, severe weather and flash flooding. Seven to 12 inches could be expected in northern areas of Pennsylvania and New York with winds gusting as high as 45 mph. Gale warnings were in effect in coastal New Jersey and Delaware areas, with gusts of 40 to 50 mph possible and forecasters warning of tree damage and resulting power outages as well as rough boating conditions. A wind advisory was in effect for other areas.
