Washington — The Senate is poised to vote on Ketanji Brown Jackson's nomination to the Supreme Court in the coming weeks, and with the conclusion of her marathon confirmation hearings, a steady flow of senators are revealing whether they will support the first Black woman to be tapped for the nation's highest court. Jackson needs the backing of a simple majority of senators in order for her nomination to clear the Senate and for the judge to take her seat on the Supreme Court. She is expected to win support from the 48 Democrats and two independents who caucus with Democrats, and Jackson received her first Republican backer Wednesday, when Sen. Susan Collins of Maine announced her intent to vote to confirm her to the Supreme Court. The White House and Democratic leaders have been hoping Jackson will be confirmed with support from senators in both parties, and Collins is so far the only Republican to announce her plan to vote "yes." Other GOP senators who are considered possible votes in support of Jackson, namely Sens. Mitt Romney of Utah and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, have not yet said what they will do. Here is where senators currently stand on Jackson's nomination, according to their most recent comments: Republicans Democrats Republicans Republicans Democrats
