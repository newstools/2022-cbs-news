Rep. Lee Zeldin, the Republican candidate for governor of New York, said Thursday that a man climbed on stage and attempted to stab him during a campaign event. Zeldin said he was not seriously injured in the attack, and the perpetrator has been taken into custody. Zeldin, who will face off against incumbent Gov. Kathy Hochul in November, said in a statement that he was speaking to supporters in Fairport, New York, when the man tried to attack him. He said he grabbed the man's wrist before others were able to subdue him on the ground. Zeldin said he was able to finish his speech after law enforcement took the man into custody. He did not provide any information about the alleged attacker. Video appeared to show a man approach Zeldin while he was speaking on stage. The man, who appeared to have something in his hand, stopped briefly before bringing his hand near Zeldin's face. Zeldin can then be seen grabbing the man's wrist before he is subdued. His spokesperson said all members of Zeldin's team, including Lieutenant Gov. nominee Alison Esposito, are safe. "This is very much getting out of hand in this state," the spokesperson said in the statetment. "Unfortunately, Congressman Zeldin is just the latest New Yorker whose life has been affected by the out of control crime and violence in New York. This needs to stop!" Hochul released a statement on Twitter saying she was "relieved to hear" Zeldin was not hurt. "I condemn this violent behavior in the strongest terms possible – it has no place in New York," she wrote. Zeldin is an Army Reserve lieutenant colonel who has represented Long Island since 2015, according to The Associated Press. He is a loyal supporter of President Trump and voted against certifying the 2020 election results, the AP said.
